# matchr
little R package for quasi/pseudo-scientific task of finding control stores in marketing/advertising tests

Lot of times large businesses will want {data/sales/marketing} {analysts/interns} to do see if their advertising and marketing
initiatives actually impacted the sales of stores. To do this, they'll want test groups that use the new scheme vs. 
control groups that don't.

Can handle up to two levels of factor variables (i.e. organize by region, district, sales rep, etc.) and will match by
average sales figures.

Caveat that this was written by a college student and this is not at all scientific.
